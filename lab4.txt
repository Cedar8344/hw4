1) Verifying the problem
Commands:
/usr/bin/ls -A
/usr/bin/ls -a
/usr/bin/ls -a -A
/usr/bin/ls --version

Issue is as described, -a -A modifier is printing out the same way as -a, where
it should be printing like -A.
Version is 8.22

2)Installing 8.29
Commands:
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

Use the wget command to download all the necceary files (8.29 Coreutils version,
signiture, and the keyring).

Commands:
gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

Output:
gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
gpg: Good signature from "Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9

Warning is only because its a public key we haven't verified on this machine.

3) Install Coreutils
Commands:
tar -xvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
cd coreutils-8.29
vi INSTALL
./configure
make
make install

Extract the coreutils-8.29 version directory from the tarball, enter it, use vi
to read the install file and follow the instructions. Configure will configure
the package and create the makefile we need. Make compiles the package. Make
install used to install the files.


4) Reproduce Bug
Commands:
cd src
./ls -a
./ls -A
./ls -a -A

-a -A assignemnt still prints out '.' and '..' like the -a command.
Bug still exists.


5) installing patch
Commands:
vi temp
patch -p1 < temp
./configure
make
make install

Vi is used to copy the patch from online into a file on our server.
Patch applies the diff changes to the ./src/ls.c file
./configure congiures the software so it can be built
make actually builds the software/patch so we can use the commands
make install installs the package.

6) Checking
./src/ls -a -A

Doesn't print out the '.' and '..' directories as we wanted, bug is fixed!
